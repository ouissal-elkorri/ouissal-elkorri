 In addition to my studies, I practice a few other disciplines (bodyboarding, basketball, yoga/meditation, 
 also traveling and discovering other cultures) that I love because each one of them teaches me something. 
 On another hand, I am a team leader in DigiGirlz Mentorship Program, a program that aims to empower high school girls 
 by connecting them with university students interested in the technology and entrepreneurship fields.
